#include "Operator.hpp"

// Since Operator is an abstract base class, most functionality is in the header.
// This file provides an implementation for any non-inline methods that might be needed.

// Currently there are no non-inline methods that need implementation here.
// This file exists to satisfy the build process that expects a .cpp file for each .hpp file.
